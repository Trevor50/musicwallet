non-commercial radio station broadcasting at 91.1 Mhz FM in Jersey City, NJ, right across the Hudson from lower Manhattan. It is currently the longest running <a href=\"http:\/\/wfmu.org\/freeform.html\">freeform<\/a> radio station in the United States. <br \/><br \/> The station also broadcasts to the Hudson Valley and Lower Catskills in New York, Western New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania via its 90.1 signal at WXHD in Mount Hope, NY. The station maintains an extensive online presence at WFMU.ORG which includes live audio streaming in several formats, over 8 years of audio archives, podcasts and a popular blog.<br \/><br \/> Rolling Stone Magazine, The Village Voice, CMJ and the New York Press have all at one time or another called WFMU \"the best radio station in the country\" and the station has also been the subject of feature stories in <a href=\"http:\/\/wfmu.org\/nytimes.html\">The New York Times<\/a> and on the BBC. In recent years the station has gained a large <a href=\"http:\/\/wfmu.org\/marathon\/map.php\">international following<\/a> due to its online operations and counts Simpson's creator Matt Groening, film director Jim Jarmusch and Velvet Underground founder Lou Reed, among others, as devoted fans of the station. <br \/><br \/> WFMU's programming ranges from flat-out uncategorizable strangeness to rock and roll, experimental music, 78 RPM Records, jazz, psychedelia, hip-hop, electronica, hand-cranked wax cylinders, punk rock, gospel, exotica, R&B, radio improvisation, cooking instructions, classic radio airchecks, found sound, dopey call-in shows, interviews with obscure radio personalities and notable science-world luminaries, spoken word collages, Andrew Lloyd Webber soundtracks in languages other than English as well as Country and western music.<br \/><br \/> All of the station's programming is controlled by individual DJs and is not beholden to any type of station-wide playlist or rotation schedule. Experimentation, spontaneity and humor are among the station's most frequently noted distinguishing traits. WFMU does not belong to any existing public radio network, and close to 100% of its programming originates at the station.<\/p>","curator_status":"active","curator_featured":"1","curator_contact_name":null,"curator_contact_email":null,"curator_address":null,"curator_notes":null,"curator_date_created":"2008-12-03 11:17:26","curator_date_modified":"2\/15\/2016 12:25:38 PM","curator_date_deleted":null,"curator_favorites":"737","curator_comments":"25","curator_playlists":"17","curator_deleted":"0","curator_billing":"99999","curator_is_featured":"1","curator_image_url":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/curators\/WFMU_-_20160215111817308.jpg","curator_site_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/curator\/WFMU\/"},{"curator_id":"1119","venue_id":null,"label_id":null,"curator_title":"Music for Video","curator_type":"curator","curator_tagline":null,"curator_handle":"Video","curator_image_file":"images\/curators\/Music_for_Video_-_20150515124516930.jpg","curator_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/video","curator_bio":"<p>The Music for Video portal seeks to\u00a0fill a void in music for online media projects by\u00a0featuring artists who wish to participate in the open sharing of their works under the <a title=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/about\/licenses\" href=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/about\/licenses\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons licensing framework<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We regularly feature Creative Commons music mixes curated with the producer in mind, as well as resources for education about <a title=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/legalmusicforvideos\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/legalmusicforvideos\" target=\"_blank\">Legal Music for Video<\/a>\u00a0and <a title=\"http:\/\/www.centerforsocialmedia.org\/fair-use\/best-practices\/online-video\" href=\"http:\/\/www.centerforsocialmedia.org\/fair-use\/best-practices\/online-video\" target=\"_blank\">Best Practices in Online Video<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you're new to the Free Music Archive and these concepts, please read our <a title=\"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/faq\" href=\"\/faq\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ<\/a>.<\/p>","curator_status":"active","curator_featured":"1","curator_contact_name":null,"curator_contact_email":"contact@freemusicarchive.org","curator_address":"43 Montgomery","curator_notes":null,"curator_date_created":"2011-09-13 16:36:33","curator_date_modified":"5\/15\/2015 12:52:38 PM","curator_date_deleted":null,"curator_favorites":"557","curator_comments":"62","curator_playlists":"9","curator_deleted":"0","curator_billing":"99998","curator_is_featured":"1","curator_image_url":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/curators\/Music_for_Video_-_20150515124516930.jpg","curator_site_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/curator\/Video\/"},{"curator_id":"1091","venue_id":null,"label_id":null,"curator_title":"ccCommunity","curator_type":"curator","curator_tagline":"Creative Commons music from around the world wide web, selected by our independent curatorial crew","curator_handle":"CCcommunity","curator_image_file":"images\/curators\/ccCommunity_-_20130117131456651.jpg","curator_url":null,"curator_bio":null,"curator_status":"active","curator_featured":"1","curator_contact_name":null,"curator_contact_email":null,"curator_address":null,"curator_notes":null,"curator_date_created":"2011-07-20 19:12:05","curator_date_modified":"1\/17\/2013 02:22:20 PM","curator_date_deleted":null,"curator_favorites":"128","curator_comments":"10","curator_playlists":"0","curator_deleted":"0","curator_billing":"100","curator_is_featured":"1","curator_image_url":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/curators\/ccCommunity_-_20130117131456651.jpg","curator_site_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/curator\/CCcommunity\/"},{"curator_id":"1527","venue_id":null,"label_id":null,"curator_title":"Needle Drop Co.","curator_type":"label","curator_tagline":"Elevate Your Story","curator_handle":"Needle_Drop_Co","curator_image_file":"images\/curators\/Needle_Drop_Co_-_20151217135548743.png","curator_url":"http:\/\/www.needledrop.co\/fma","curator_bio":"<p>Needle Drop Co. is a full service music agency specializing in library music licensing, music supervision and original music production.

This world of \u201cNetaudio\u201d is generally released freely, either independently or through Netlabels. As this culture continues to grow, the amount of available music grows exponentially making it increasingly difficult for folks who are new to the culture to filter the good from the bad. Each of our free releases, in one way or another, are an attempt to shine the spotlight on what we think is the best of what this world has to offer.<\/p>\n<p>Consider blocSonic a filter through which you can discover this vibrant, global culture! Currently there are three ways which we spotlight what the netaudio world has to offer:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blocsonic.com\/releases\/type\/originals\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Originals<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p>During our travels through the wide-world of netaudio culture, we find artists who stand out and who we feel would be perfect to spotlight independently in original blocSonic album releases.

These re-releases contain the original album as well as at least a bonus disc worth of material (remixes, demos, outtakes, new material and\/or other unreleased material). They also feature fresh album art and as with all our releases an extensive PDF booklet.<\/p>\n<p>Each Xtended Edition features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>At least 1 disc worth of bonus material<\/li>\n<li>Available in a choice of three high-quality audio formats \u2014 <a href=\"http:\/\/flac.sourceforge.net\/faq.html#general__what_is\">Lossless FLAC<\/a>, 320kbs MP3 and 192kbs MP3.<\/li>\n<li>Complete new album art is available in three formats \u2014 EPS, PDF and TIF.<\/li>\n<li>40+ page PDF booklet with complete liner-notes, lyrics, photos and album credits.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blocsonic.com\/releases\/type\/netblocs\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">netBlocs<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Each of these eclectic releases shine a spotlight on ten or so international audio gems culled from the Netaudio culture.

Since no formal permission has been acquired, links to the original files are provided rather than compiling them into a proper release. However, a cover and a tracklisting is provided in order for you to burn them to disc, if you'd like.<\/p>\n<p>Why do we do what we do? We love music, we love netaudio and have found that the quality and variety of what\u2019s coming out of this culture is superior to that of much of what\u2019s coming out of the mainstream music industry. We feel more secure donating to netaudio artists\/labels then we do purchasing formulaic music-product from the majors. We\u2019d like you to also feel that way toward the netaudio culture. We realize that most people don\u2019t have the time and\/or patience to filter through it all to find the good stuff, so we invest the time to find the gems in the ruff and deliver them to you in our releases.<\/p>\n<p>In between releases, you can also look forward to blog posts about netaudio news or topics relating to DRM and online music.<\/p>\n<p>So subscribe to our\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/blocsonic.com\/feed\">feed<\/a>\u00a0and discover great new openly-licensed music every month.
